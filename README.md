# CDC_Combinational_Logic

Key points in this version

comb_logic_A holds the combinational expression a & b | c.

sigA_reg is the clkA-domain registered version â†’ removes glitches.

sync1 and sync2 are the two-flop synchronizer in clkB domain â†’ handles metastability.

Output sigB is now safe to use in clkB domain.

Handling Clock Domain Crossing (CDC) in FPGA/ASIC Designs

In digital design, signals often need to move between different clock domains. Directly connecting them can cause metastability, glitches, or unpredictable behavior.

âœ… How to safely synchronize signals across clock domains:

Single-bit control signals:

Register the signal in the source clock domain.

Use a two-flip-flop synchronizer in the destination clock domain to safely resolve metastability.

Multi-bit data buses:

Use handshake protocols (valid/ack) or asynchronous FIFOs to safely transfer data.

ðŸ’¡ Rule of Thumb:

1 flip-flop in the source domain â†’ remove glitches.

2 flip-flops in the destination domain â†’ handle metastability.

This simple approach ensures robust, predictable behavior when crossing clocks, and is a standard best practice in FPGA and ASIC designs.
